# My first executable program
I know this may be a basic calculator app but I have learnt a lot of things while building this app

I used python and customtkinter library to build this in 2 days only. I learnt the basics of building a calculator from a random tutorial but i modified it and it looks so much better than the one the tutorial guy made. Ill even put the link of the tutoral down below ðŸ‘‡

As he was using the .place() method, i found it to be very tedious so I went to the tkinter website, learnt about the grid and column system and then proceeded to make it, then I used the pyinstaller library to turn it into an executable file. 

Anyways its not perfect but it gets the job done.

P.S:  I'll upload the source code too
